        I just randomly decided to make a website using html. I'm learning as I go, so it might not look
        very good at the moment. 
    </p>

    <p style="font-size:22px;width:800px;">
        The reason I started learning HTML in the first place is because, someone needed help with 
        formatting text in the ERP-Software SAP at work. I just had to google for about two minutes
        to find the "&amp;nbsp". Then I thought "Maybe i could learn a bit more and see what else can
        be done." Pretty soon after, I got the idea for this Website.

        Also I really Love cats if you couldn't tell by the general theme!

    </p>

    <p style="font-size:22px;width:820px;">

        The design and idea is inspired, in part, by <a href="https://alf-s-room.com/" target="_blank"> Alf's room </a>. <br>Absolutely check that site out 
        (if you speak japanese, that is)
